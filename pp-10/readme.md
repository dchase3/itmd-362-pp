# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

1. Desktop_Home.png - Homepage on desktop/laptop view
2. Desktop_Acedemic.png - Acedemics tab on desktop/laptop view
3. Mobile_Home1.png - Homepage on mobile view with navbar hidden
4. Mobile_Home2.png - Homepage on mobile view with navbar visible
5. Mobile_Acedemic.png - Acedemics tab on mobile view

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
