## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55B0v0k-SLUctVUnIPrIeqKMacF
Your Rationale: The two main consoles currently are xbox and playstation which have the main colors of green and blue hues respectively
                so I decided to go for a vibrant red because it stands out but is different than the other consoles.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3070l0k-SLUctVUnIPrIeqKMacF
Your Rationale: For spring time I focused on the light green and sky blue because when I think of spring those are he first colors on my mind.
                The extra reds don't hurt and can be used for flowers to add some contrast.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=34b1j0kIgjbB4ATTerJJ86TWY4V
Your Rationale: The last two I went really bright and had the colors stick out, but for a login page I thought maybe a few darker colors
                with colors from around the entire spectrum with red blue and green might look nice without straining anyones eyes.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kJLqLk-yEztDuPMjEWHc7
Your Rationale: This one was easy, for ruby I just started with a nice bright red and just spread it out a bit to make sure there was a
                nice collection of some lighter and darker reds
