# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

NOTE: Not necessarily something that one normally "uses" but I do.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: It imediately catches the eye of any Star Wars fan because even though it's a charicature it's obvious who it's supposed to be and it's just adorable.

* Behavioral: Sometimes when overstressed or when I get tunnel vision I just bounce his head for a little bit and watch him bobble to clear my mind and calm me.

* Reflective: It's not a complex tool, it's a simple goofy nick nack. It's nothing special which is exactly what's nice about it. It serves its purpose to sit there and draw your attention every once in a while.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Catches the users eye easily by being familiar.
2. Calm interface that only shows what the user wants.
3. Don't overcomplicate something that only needs to be simple.
