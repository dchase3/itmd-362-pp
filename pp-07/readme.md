# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742471.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: When username and password are not entered correctly an error
                                         message will appear above the login box.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742468.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: To be touch friendly the username/password can be larger than
                                         on the MyIIT portal and will be in the very middle of the screen
                                         so it's much easier to select.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742482.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The login forms will be slightly darker than the surrounding
                                         area so that it's easy to tell them apart.
